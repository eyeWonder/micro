#Dancer

Dancer is an add-on that will be standard where possible, like the text editing lambda. 

Dancer is the REPL and debug hook. It visually displays the path of parse execution by an interrupt triggered by a write to the TX pin, costing only space unless the Orc is connected. 

I may name other standard libraries after reindeer, introspection ones at least.
