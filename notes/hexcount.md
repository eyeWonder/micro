#Hex Counting

Yet another random thought I've mulled over. Counting in hex is awkward. Here's an englishism for doing so. 

    A - Alf
    B - Bet
    C - Cap
    D - Del
    E - Eps
    F - Fun

    14 - Fourteen 
    1A - Alfteen
    1B - Betteen
    1C - Capteen
    1D - Delteen
    E  - Epsteen
    F  - Funteen
        
    A0 - Alfy
    B0 - Betty
    C0 - Cappi
    D1 - Deltyone
    EA - Epsialf
    FF - Funny
        
    B05 - Bet hexdred five
      
    E000 - Eps Kay.

    D41F - Del kay four hexdred and funteen, or delty four funteen 

    1234 One kay two hexdred thirty four, twelve thirty four.


Simple and easy. Should become habit.
