#Flux Capacitor

Sentient beings of science, I present to you, the flux capacitor.

We do chemistry, with the flux capacitor. It combines two of our favorite things, liquids and electricity, and does chemistry. Let me illustrate.

##The Flux Capacitor Core

A simple flux capacitor has a positively doped carbon core channel, technically a solvated aerogel or hydrogel in the case of aqueous reactions. This is surrounded by a hydrogel layer of silica, negatively doped. We call these the acid channel and the base channel, and they may be reversed.

This is surrounded by an exchange membrane, large enough to exclude the molecules under assembly. This has another, lightly doped carbon layer, the reagent layer. It is surrounded by an insulated, watertight membrane, something in the teflon class, quite thin. This has an aerogel layer of carbon, another membrane, and a final, anone silica layer, with an insulating sheath. These are the capacitor. The whole object is roughly two centimeters diameter, and can probably be made smaller with changes to the design. Much smaller: see below.

##Operation

The acid channel will tend to retain negatively charged particles, the base channel, positive. These may be pulled in opposite directions by driving an electric current through the medium. This may be augmented, supplemented, or dampened by hydraulic flow, injecting either into the rim, center, or normally both in a countercurrent fashion. 

Depending on flux versus lateral current, we move particles across the inner and outer channels by either weight or by degree of charge. 

We flow reagents over the reaction belt using the reagent channel, then fire up the capacitance. This causes everything to leave its region: our particle of interest migrates to the basic channel, our reagents are compelled into the basic channel, and the catalysts on the surfaces in the basic channel go to work. When capacitance is released, lateral current is applied, restoring everything to normalcy. 

##Polymer

So we load a polymer on the belt. It has a strongly positive terminal which we've protected, and negative brushes. We flood a reagent in protic salt form into the reaction channel, the protons will want to migrate across the exchange membrane when we push and pull but will have to return when we drop current to neutral.

When we fire up the capacitor, it attracts the brush and repels the reagent, which combine in the basic zone into either an ionic or covalent bond. Relax, lateral pull, the now heavier and more neutral reacted brushes lag, so we do a bit of separation, backflow, and keep reaction. For the sake of argument, we push the brushes halfway up the column, then pull back and forth, one step forward, two steps back, until we have fully reacted brushes.

##Nanoparticle

New tube, we load up the nanoparticles on one end in the acid channel and the now unprotected, terminal exposed brushes in the negative. We flow any reagents needed, and capacity-combine and AC separate as described above. 

That's the story. It fluxes, it capacitates, flux, capacitor. 

There is so much more we can do with this that it's insane. Let's stick with the basics. 
 
##Microfluidic

We make thin glass sandwiches instead of tubes. Trench the first one, scrape some carbon aerogel in there, clamp it, vacuum. Through cut the second one, clamp bottom, scrape silica aerogel, clamp top, vac. Add an exchange membrane, reagent layer, teflon, put down two clean layers of aerogel as a cap, seal. does the same thing.

If we have say a thousand dopants to try out, we can 3-d print them one per channel, instead of scraping. 

##Pressure and gasses

For more advanced operations we can build voids and use pressure to inject from our reagent channel into the basic channel through the membrane. Not all reagents will be charged and we want a nice general way to inject them at the work site. Gasses can be diffused by injecting a bubble into a void, then applying pressure to both ends, causing it to disperse accordingly. I'm thinking particularly of hydrogen for doing reductions in a base-centered system with a palladium-catalysed carbon reaction region. We shoot hydrogen into a void and push it through the matrix, which dries, adsorbing the carbon to the palladium, roughly 900 mols of h2 per mol palladium, this reduces the pressure allowin the solvent system to flow back int. We can increase pressure further at this point if required. 

This is a different kind of chemistry, and figuring out how to manipulate conditions accordingly will be a long road. I'm trying not to spin too far off topic, the early flux capacitors will assemble our nanoparticles. But I feel like I can use this technique to build anything, and in surprising ways, there are some remarkable results from surface chemistry. But I am in danger of digressing.

##Heat

We can provide precise heat, throughout the reaction, instantaneously, along a gradient if desired, within a particular region of the chain. Here's how.

Induction causes heating in ferrous metals. These are normally subject to rapid oxidation, but pure iron may be finely powdered and screened in a nitrogen atmosphere with minimal risk of explosion. This can then be electroplated with platinum, the resulting particles incorporated into the reaction matrix, and induction applied to the desired region. I don't know of any similar trick for cooling that doesn't involve lasers. 

##Solvent Swaps

The molecule under assembly may need a solvent swap at some point in the chain. We can use these inducting particles and low pressure in combination to induce instantaneous boiling with crystallization or surface adherance taking place within the matrix, mostly avoiding clogging the permeable membrane that releases the gas phase. 

We can then perform dry phase chemistry if desireable, or redissolve into a new solvent system, with gentle heat introduced throughout the crystals at the points of nucleation. This will assure resolvation. 

##Precipitation

Certain classes of reaction induce precipitation, in this case onto the surrounding matrix. Care must be shown to leave sufficient room for solvent flow for this application. In this case it suffices to dry the crystals with a working gas and resolvate, heating if necessary. In this case introducing the new solvent at adequate pressure and temperature will do the trick without fancy induction gizmos. 


##General Idea

Basically, the reaction environment is hostile, and the moving channel is friendly, to the bond we attack. By nature, the bond, and the molecule containing it, will avoid each other, and we can emphasize this by passing current through the base and acid channel, making them more hostile and more friendly.

By applying the capacitor, everything with any kind of charge is forced to migrate towards the hostile zone. The reagents and targets, being both friendly, don't quite want to react with each other, but get agitated in conditions of mutual hostility and bond together, aided by friendly surface catalysts. When we relax the electric field, things migrate to where they feel comfortable. 

In ordinary chemistry, we use thermodynamic noise to cause two things that don't quite want to bond to slam into each other. Reactions that simply want to go forward regardless are freebies. Usually we're trying to tweak things, or we heat them up or use pressure. All of these are ways of increasing desperation the face of reluctance.

The biological model is the spring enzyme, which draws in one reagent and another, slams them together, and walks away. The solid state equivalence is applying the flux capacitor. We'll be working from surface-chemistry papers and obscure electro research, since this is a bit like anode and cathode chemistry and a lot like surface catalysis chemistry. In general reactions should happen under friendlier, more specific conditions.
