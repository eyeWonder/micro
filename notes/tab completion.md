#Tab Completion

This is so crazy that it'll work. 

The tab key attempts to finish your symbol by lookup. Dancer on up, of course. 

If there's only one option, it will turn green and finish it. If there are multiple, it presents the first in yellow, and you can keep tabbing or hit space to accept. If it cannot be made into a valid two-part token (no spaz) it turns red, you can delete it or hit space to color it according to its overall semantics and continue coding. Or delete it. Which reminds me, adding delete is a priority...
